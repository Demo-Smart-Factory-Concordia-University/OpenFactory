What is OpenFactory?
--------------------

OpenFactory is an Industry 4.0 platform for orchestrating industrial assets and managing their data flows. 
It is designed around a data-driven approach, where information is processed and acted upon as it is generated
rather than being queried after the fact. This enables real-time data processing, supporting applications that 
require continuous insight and responsiveness.

OpenFactory aligns conceptually with the RAMI 4.0 reference architecture, particularly in how it models assets 
and their capabilities. Its technical design choices, such as distributed deployment, service replication,
and support for both modern and legacy equipment, are driven by the need for robustness and scalability
in real-world industrial environments.

For a clear vision and guiding principles of OpenFactory, see the :doc:`OpenFactory Manifesto <MANIFESTO>`.
