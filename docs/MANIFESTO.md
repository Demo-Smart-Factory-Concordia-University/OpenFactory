# 🏭 OpenFactory Manifesto

> **Making the Physical World Versionable, Testable, Programmable — and Connected at Scale**

## 🌐 The Problem

Factories today are too often black boxes:

* Asset configurations are hidden in vendor tools or tribal memory
* Deployments are manual, brittle, and hard to reproduce
* Data is siloed, delayed, or lost entirely
* Assets rarely collaborate beyond fixed, hard-coded logic
* Scaling to hundreds of assets breaks the architecture

Meanwhile, in the software world:

* Everything is version-controlled, testable, and observable
* Systems scale to millions of users with real-time coordination
* Change is traceable, safe, and automatable

> **Why can’t the real world work the same way?**

---

## 🚀 Our Belief

We believe factories should be:

* **Defined in code**
* **Deployed with confidence**
* **Tested before commissioning**
* **Auditable after changes**
* **Collaborative by design**
* **Scalable by default**

> Factories are not static.
> They are living, distributed, data-driven systems.

## 🔧 What OpenFactory Is

**OpenFactory is a deployment and coordination framework for the physical world.**

It turns configuration files into factories, and assets into live, connected services.

With OpenFactory:

- ✅ Assets are described as **versioned YAML**, enabling traceability and reuse
- ✅ Services are deployed **declaratively**, supporting consistent, automated operations
- ✅ Simulators enable **safe testing**, before hardware is ever touched
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines bring **DevOps to the shop floor**, ensuring continuous delivery
- ✅ Every change is **tracked, repeatable, and explainable**, supporting auditability
- ✅ **Thousands of assets** operate in **real-time collaboration**, across the factory floor
- ✅ Data streams are processed with **high throughput** and **low-latency distributed flow**

> This isn’t just an orchestrator —
> It’s the digital nervous system of your factory.

## 🧱 Core Principles

1. **Configuration as Truth**
   The YAML file is the contract — not a hidden machine-side tweak.

2. **Declarative Over Imperative**
   Describe the desired state. Let OpenFactory enforce it.

3. **Simulate First, Deploy Later**
   Every production line should run in software before running in steel.

4. **GitOps for the Physical World**
   Changes move through commits, not chaos.

5. **Make Deployment an API**
   People and machines can trigger deployments the same way.

6. **Scale Without Fear**
   Whether you manage 5 assets or 5,000, the experience stays the same.

7. **Data Should Flow, Not Wait**
   Assets don’t just emit data — they **collaborate** in real time.
   Data flows freely and instantly between services.

## 🌍 Our Vision

Imagine:

* A new packaging line is proposed in Europe. You simulate it in Canada. It passes. You deploy it to production with confidence.
* A quality control station in Line A streams results to a predictive model that updates parameters on a press in Line B — in real time.
* A change to a robot configuration triggers a validation pipeline, simulation, and staged deployment — all tracked and versioned in Git.
* Your entire factory — every sensor, every controller, every flow — is visible, reproducible, and connected.

> OpenFactory makes the real world programmable —
> **and connected, at scale.**

## 📣 Call to Action

This is an invitation:

- To integrators: **Ship code, not USB sticks**
- To operators: **Trust deployments, not word of mouth**
- To manufacturers: **Treat your factories like software — and scale with confidence**
- To builders: **Help shape the next generation of programmable, collaborative industry**

### 👷 OpenFactory

* Factories as Code. 
* Deployment as API.
* Collaboration in Real Time.
* Scale Without Fragility.
