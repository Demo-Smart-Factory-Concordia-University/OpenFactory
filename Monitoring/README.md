# Metrics Monitoring
Docker compose instructions to wire up a metrics monitoring pipline for the [Kafka Cluster](../Kafka-Cluster/) using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to send the metrics data to [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

The collection of metrics data is already included in the Docker Compose projects of the [Kafka Cluster](../Kafka-Cluster/).
