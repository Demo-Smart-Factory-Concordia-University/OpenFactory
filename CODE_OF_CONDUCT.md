## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, and we have a zero-tolerance policy for any behavior that promotes or enables violations, hate, or harmful ideologies.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include, but are not limited to:

- The use of offensive or inappropriate language, including hate speech or discriminatory language
- Promoting or endorsing harmful ideologies, including racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any form of hate speech or violence
- Personal attacks, trolling, or insulting behavior
- Public or private harassment, intimidation, or threats of violence
- Publishing others' private information without their explicit permission
- Any content, behavior, or actions that promote or enable violations of our community's values
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Removal of Contributions

By contributing to this project, you agree that the project maintainers reserve the right to remove or modify your contributions if your actions, behavior, or content (such as avatars, comments, or code) are found to violate the project's Code of Conduct or values. This includes, but is not limited to, removing content that is discriminatory, harmful, or in violation of community standards.

The project has a **zero-tolerance policy** towards any form of promotion, encouragement, or endorsement of harmful, illegal, or hate-driven ideologies. Any contributions, content, or actions that are deemed to violate this policy may be permanently removed or modified to protect the integrity and values of the project.

We are committed to ensuring that the project remains a welcoming and inclusive space for all, and will take prompt action to uphold these values, including removing or modifying contributions that conflict with our mission or Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer directly at **rolf.wuthrich@concordia.ca**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We request that reports be submitted privately to avoid public escalation and ensure a respectful and confidential resolution process.

In exceptional cases, if a contributor feels uncomfortable with a private report, they may choose to raise the issue in a GitHub issue with limited visibility, but the preferred method is through direct communication via email.

If a violation occurs, the project maintainers will issue a private, written warning to the contributor, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and explaining why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested, depending on the situation.

The project maintainers are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. They will take appropriate and fair action in response to any violations, which may include issuing a warning, temporary suspension, or permanent removal from the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the project, including the GitHub repository, issue tracker, discussion forums, and any other channels related to the project. It also applies to any project-related events, whether in person or online.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.
